# Website_PolizeiHive1
Welcome to the GitHub page for the former website of the Police Unit within the Eisenschmiede Gaming Project.

Our website served as a hub for essential documents related to police operations, internship information, and an introduction to our leadership team. Unfortunately, the site has since been closed and is now outdated.

However, we are excited to announce the launch of our new website, which will serve as a more up-to-date and comprehensive resource for the police unit. We have provided a link below to access the new website, where you will find the latest information, important documents, and updates related to our operations.

Link to the new website: https://sites.google.com/view/police-hive-1/startseite

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the closure of the previous website. We highly encourage you to explore our new website to stay informed and engaged with the Eisenschmiede Gaming Project's police unit. 

Thank you for your continued support and thanks to all contributors: Justin Kosten (Justin), John McGarrett (Hannes) and John McTeabow (Yanik).

Best regards,

The Eisenschmiede Gaming police leadership
